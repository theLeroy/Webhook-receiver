# Webhook-receiver

Webhook Receiver is nice and simple. It allows you to easily save data in an external endpoint. This is especially useful if you need to give this information to someone who can not be **logged in**. Also, it can serve as a **backup or as a log folder** for things like Jenkings, Github, Docker, Stripe and many more.

## How to use?

*There is an open version available on [http://Webhook.space] but it would also be possible to host it yourself. (Pls credit me)*

- Create e new Endpoint on the Frontpage [http://Webhook.space]
- Copy the Url and send Webhooks to this Url.
  *(I recomend not tu use Url Formating)*
 
 
### Token/Hash
>The **Url contains the Token** whitch is the Indefier to se the received Webhooks. But mutch easyer ist to just save the URL. The token has a lengh of 64 Caracters
This is very easy. No passwort is required and this alow a very quick access. All you need is the Token.


### Link
The link is starting with *webhook.space:9000/r/us/* this is same fore every endpoint. After that it ends with the Unic Token
